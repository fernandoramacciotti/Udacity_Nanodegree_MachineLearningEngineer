# Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

This repository contains projects and exercises from Udacity's Machine Learning
Engineer Nanodegree.

The repository is organized as follows:

- [Capstone project](./projects/capstone): Machine learning techniques were 
applied onto the famous NASA dataset to predict remaining useful life of 
aircrafts' turbofan engines. The final submitted paper can be 
found [here](./projects/capstone/paper/Ramacciotti2018_PredictingRUL.pdf).

- [Boston Housing](./projects/boston_housing): House selling prices were
predicted with machine learning. The dataset is the famous Boston housing dataset.

- [Student Intervention](./projects/student_intervention): Machine learning models
were built in order to predict whether a student needs intervention in order to
help him/her to graduate.

- [Customer Segmentation](./projects/customer_segments): Unsupervised techniques
were applied for clustering a customer database.
